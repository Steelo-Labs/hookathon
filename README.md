# Steelo's Uniswap v4 Integration for the Atrium Academy Hookathon

## Introduction

Welcome to Steelo's submission for the Atrium Academy Hookathon. Our project focuses on integrating Uniswap v4 into our decentralized platform using the **EIP-2535 Diamond Standard**, enabling a modular and upgradable contract architecture. Steelo aims to revolutionize the creator-investor relationship by providing an intuitive, frictionless mobile application that empowers users to financially support their favorite creators.

## Key Achievements

1. **Successful Integration of Uniswap v4 with Diamond Standard Architecture**  
   We have integrated Uniswap v4 into our platform using the EIP-2535 Diamond Standard. This allows for a modular and upgradable contract structure, ensuring our platform can evolve without compromising security or functionality.

2. **Deployment of Uniswap v4 on Sepolia Testnet**  
   Uniswap v4 has been deployed on the Sepolia testnet, providing a testing ground for our contract interactions and facilitating further development and testing.

3. **Finalized Front-End Demo**  
   We have developed a front-end demo that showcases the user interface and user experience of our platform. This demo will be connected to our backend cloud functions and blockchain integration in the coming weeks.

## Key Limitations and Future Work

While we have made significant progress, there are areas we plan to enhance:

1. **Complexity of Integrating Uniswap v4 with the Diamond Standard**  
   Relying on the EIP-2535 Diamond Standard introduced challenges in integrating Uniswap v4. Special thanks to **Haardik** for his invaluable support in navigating these complexities.

2. **Ongoing Integration of Bazaar Functions and Hooks**  
   The integration of the Sepolia Uniswap deployment with our Bazaar functions and hooks is in progress. We are actively working on finalizing this integration and expect to complete it shortly.

## Code Structure

The current implementation, though still under development, can be found in the following directories:

### Hooks Implementation

- **Core Logic for Uniswap v4 Hooks**  
  `Diamond/Contracts/Libraries/LibBazaarHooks.sol`

- **Wrapping Facet for Hooks Library**  
  `Diamond/Contracts/Facets/BazaarHooksFacet.sol`

### Uniswap Mechanisms

- **Custom Router Integrating Uniswap v4 Functionality**  
  `Diamond/Contracts/Libraries/LibBazaarRouter.sol`

- **Wrapping Facet for Router Library**  
  `Diamond/Contracts/Facets/BazaarRouterFacet.sol`

### Shared Data Structures and Constants

- **Variables, Structs, and Constants**  
  `Diamond/Contracts/Libraries/LibAppStorage.sol`

### Medal Award Hook Functions

- **Functions Related to Awarding Medals**  
  `Diamond/Contracts/Libraries/LibGalleryMedals.sol`  
  *Called within* `LibBazaarHooks.sol` *and exposed through the corresponding facet.*

### Token Contracts

- **ERC-20 Token ($STLO) Implementation**  
  `Diamond/Contracts/Libraries/LibSteelo.sol`  
  Wrapping Facet: `Diamond/Contracts/Facets/STEELOFacet.sol`

- **ERC-1155 Token ($STZ) Implementation**  
  `Diamond/Contracts/Libraries/LibSteez.sol`  
  Wrapping Facet: `Diamond/Contracts/Facets/STEEZFacet.sol`

## Challenges Faced

### Technical Complexities

- **Integration Difficulties**: Combining Uniswap v4 with the Diamond Standard architecture required navigating uncharted territories in smart contract development.
- **Advanced Implementations**: Utilizing the Diamond Standard and Polygon's zkEVM testnet increased the complexity, especially in integrating and deploying Uniswap v4.

### Resource Constraints

- **Time Limitations**: The ambitious scope of integrating advanced technologies within the Hookathon timeframe posed significant challenges.
- **Team Challenges**: Our key technical lead faced unforeseen circumstances that impacted our development schedule. Despite this, we made substantial progress and are confident in completing the remaining integration soon.

## Acknowledgments

We extend our sincere gratitude to **Haardik** for his continuous support and guidance throughout this project.

## Next Steps

Hookathon aside, we are honoured and grateful to have had the opportunity to work with the Atrium Academy team and their guest lecurers.
Furthermore, we are committed to finalizing the integration of our Bazaar functions and hooks with the Uniswap v4 deployment. Over the next few weeks, we will:

- **Complete Integration**: Finalize the connection between the Sepolia Uniswap deployment and our Bazaar functions.
- **Backend Connection**: Connect the front-end demo to our cloud functions and blockchain backend.
- **Thorough Testing**: Conduct extensive testing to ensure robustness, security, and optimal performance.
- **Alpha Release**: Prepare for an alpha release of the Steelo platform, including both iOS and Android versions, to allow for 500+ user testing and feedback.

## Conclusion

We are proud of the progress made during the Hookathon and are excited about the potential of our platform to reshape the creator-investor landscape. The challenges faced have strengthened our resolve, and we are eager to continue building and refining Steelo.
